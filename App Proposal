Goals	

- To create an expense tracker app which helps people to track and manage their daily expenses, while also promoting financial literacy and responsible spending.

- To align the app's features with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 
SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production).

- To explore possibilities to improve financial inclusion by making the app available to underprivileged communities and including features that promote

Roles	
- I am a developer working on an expense tracker app that will help people manage their finances, track expenses, and promote financial literacy.

- I am also a researcher that aims on aligning the application with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the goal to contribute to 
poverty reduction, economic growth, and responsible spending.

Audience	

- Users looking for a dependable and user-friendly expense tracker app that helps them manage their finances, track everyday expenses, and improve their 
financial literacy.

- Underprivileged communities who can benefit from easily accessible financial management tools that promote responsible spending and financial stability.

- Organizations and advocates who promote financial literacy and being inclusive may benefit from an app that aligns with the United Nations' Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs).

Situation	

- Many people experience financial problems as a result of poor handling of finances, a lack in financial literacy, and limited access to resources that can 
assist them in efficiently tracking, saving, and budgeting their spending, especially in underprivileged and low-income regions. They consequently regularly 
overspend, disregard savings, and accumulate debt, all of which make their financial difficulties worse. Many people lack the resources to manage their finances 
because financial tools are sometimes too expensive or complicated. Sustainable financial practices are also becoming more and more important in order to assist 
individuals make wise financial decisions, save for the future, and live within their means. By aligning with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs), particularly those addressing poverty reduction, economic growth, and responsible consumption, the expense tracker app aims to provide accessible 
solutions that promote financial literacy, stability, and inclusivity.
